# What is an API
- An API is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software.

# What is a Restful API
- Restful API is a safe and secure way for two computer/programs to communicate with each other. They can receive, delete, edit or send information to the server.

# Why learn Rest API with python
## 1. Easy to Learn and Implement
- If you’re familiar with the HTTP and client-server architecture then you can easily understand the REST API and you can easily implement it in your project.
## 2. Scalability
- This is one of the best features that makes REST stands out when compared to others. Separation of client and server in REST architecture allows the developers to scale apps more easily.
## 3. Cacheable
- We all want to boost the performance of the web application. Caching plays a crucial role in sending back a faster response to the user. If you’re making the same request several times then you don’t need to get the data from the server multiple times. You can easily cache the data and quickly get the response from the cache memory.
## 4. Flexibility and Portability
- In REST, it is easy to update the data in the database at any moment. It gives the flexibility to answer many clients asking for different data types (XML, JSON, and so on). All you just need to do is to request the data types using the Accept header. REST will return the response depending on the specified data types.

# Why python is a good language for developing rest API
- Python is considered a beginner-friendly language. This means that it has an excellent community base with experienced teachers available to help you learn Python. It's also easy to write code for beginners since there are no complex rules when writing like other languages (i.e., C++). This means you can focus on learning the language itself rather than worrying about more difficult syntax.
# What is a Rest API call?
- Now that we have a gist of what an API is and what it does, let’s switch our attention to an API call. Simply put, the moment you add an endpoint to a URL and send a request to a server, this is what counts as making an API call. For example, when you log on to any app or ask a question via a browser, you are actually making an API call.
